#### First-Step Drill-Down: Screening Records by Patient MRN

#### Second-Step Drill-Down: Screening Details

For every **Screening Record**, users can access an additional drill-down that provides comprehensive details about that particular screening. This includes:

- **Observation Screening Records**: A summary of observations recorded during the screening process.
- **Questions and Answers**: A detailed view of the questions asked during the screening, along with the user-submitted answers.

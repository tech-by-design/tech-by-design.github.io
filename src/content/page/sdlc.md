# Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Effective Date:** September 29, 2024 
**Review Cycle:** Annual

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This document defines the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) process for all software systems that process, store, or transmit protected health information (PHI) and electronic protected health information (ePHI). This SDLC framework attempts to maintain compliance with HIPAA Security Rule requirements, including 45 CFR ยง 164.308(a)(7) and ยง 164.312(b).

## 2. SDLC Phases

### 2.1 Planning and Requirements

- **Business Requirements:** Document functional and non-functional requirements, including security and privacy requirements
- **Risk Assessment:** Conduct preliminary security risk assessment to identify potential threats to PHI/ePHI
- **Compliance Review:** Verify requirements alignment with HIPAA, HITECH, and applicable state regulations
- **Stakeholder Approval:** Obtain documented approval from business owners and security officer

### 2.2 Design

- **System Architecture:** Define system components, data flows, and integration points
- **Security Design:** Implement security controls including access controls, encryption, audit logging, and data integrity measures
- **Privacy by Design:** Incorporate minimum necessary access principles and data minimization strategies
- **Design Review:** Conduct security and compliance review of design documents

### 2.3 Development

- **Secure Coding Standards:** Follow OWASP guidelines and organization-specific secure coding practices
- **Code Review:** Perform peer code reviews with security focus
- **Version Control:** Maintain all code in approved version control system with access logging
- **Security Testing:** Conduct testing with security test cases

### 2.4 Testing

- **Functional Testing:** Verify requirements are met through comprehensive test plans
- **Security Testing:** Perform vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, and security control validation
- **Integration Testing:** Test data flows and system interactions with focus on data security
- **User Acceptance Testing:** Validate system meets business and compliance requirements

### 2.5 Deployment

- **Change Management:** Follow formal change control procedures with documented approvals
- **Deployment Validation:** Verify security controls are properly configured in production environment
- **Documentation:** Update system documentation, security documentation, and operational procedures
- **Training:** Provide necessary training to end users and support staff

### 2.6 Maintenance and Monitoring

- **Patch Management:** Apply security patches and updates according to established timelines
- **Security Monitoring:** Continuously monitor systems for security events and anomalies
- **Incident Response:** Maintain incident response procedures for security events
- **Periodic Review:** Conduct annual security risk assessments and compliance reviews

## 3. Security Controls Integration

All phases incorporate the following security controls:

- **Access Control:** Role-based access control (RBAC) with unique user identification
- **Audit Controls:** Logging of system activity, especially PHI/ePHI access
- **Integrity Controls:** Mechanisms to ensure data is not improperly altered or destroyed
- **Transmission Security:** Encryption of PHI/ePHI in transit using industry-standard protocols
- **Encryption:** Encryption of PHI/ePHI at rest using approved algorithms

## 4. Documentation Requirements

Required documentation maintained throughout SDLC:

- Requirements specifications
- Security risk assessments
- Design documents and architecture diagrams
- Code review records
- Test plans and test results
- Security testing reports
- Change control records
- Deployment validation documentation
- Training records

## 5. Roles and Responsibilities

- **Product Owner:** Requirements definition and business approval
- **Security Officer:** Security review and compliance validation
- **Development Team:** Secure coding and security testing
- **QA Team:** Comprehensive testing including security testing
- **Operations Team:** Deployment, monitoring, and maintenance

## 6. Compliance and Audit

This SDLC process is reviewed annually and updated as needed to maintain compliance with:

- HIPAA Security Rule (45 CFR Part 164, Subpart C)
- HIPAA Privacy Rule (45 CFR Part 164, Subpart E)
- HITECH Act requirements
- State-specific healthcare regulations

All SDLC activities are documented and available for audit purposes.

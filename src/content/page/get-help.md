## Philosophy

Technology by Design believes in offering help publicly through a variety of resources. We strongly encourage you to use the Frequent Help Topics noted below as a starting point for finding the assistance that you may need. You are likely to find your answers in the topics below faster than you would sending us communication. We strive to continuously update and improve our help documentation here but also within the links and guides that follow. We appreciate the collaboration within self-service and documentation tools as that is most often the best way to ensure up-to-date information is available to all we partner with.

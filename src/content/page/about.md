## History

Technology by Design, or Tech by Design, was borne of a consortium of New York eHealth Collaborative and 4 health information exchanges in New York state - Bronx Rhio, HealtheConnections, HEALTHeLINK, and Rochester RHIO. The consortium is now the board that governs Tech by Design's by-laws and continues to play a major role in planning for implementation and adoption of objectives set forth for Technology by Design.

### Primary Objective

Tech by Design’s primary objective is to implement and maintain a robust, cost-effective technology platform to support the state’s QEs in delivering high-quality services to their participants. The platform branded Fusion is designed to improve operational efficiencies and enable innovation while maintaining economic sustainability.

### Secondary Objective

While meeting the primary objective set out by the original consortium, it was also recognized that Tech by Design will be uniquely positioned to create new collaborative services that don't exist today. In doing so, Tech by Design will be able to implement new innovations that can be efficiently made available to the entire state. One such example of this is sending HRSN screening documents through Tech By Design to the New York State data lake. This project is called the 1115 Waiver project and is already underway with expected launch in Q1 of 2025.

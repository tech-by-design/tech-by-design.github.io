## Training Material 
As there are various products available through InterSystems, users need to be mindful of the training they are choosing to spend their time on, and ensure it is related to a product line they have access to and will be using. For users from Technology by Design and partnering organizations (i.e. QEs), this means limiting the scope of your search to the following HealthShare products:
- Health Insight (Analytics tool)
- Unified Care Record (Clinical Viewer)

To filter on these data points, use the left-hand side of the screen to select the topics which you want to focus on. You can also use the search functionality to search for a topic using key words. 

Once you find a course you would like to explore, click into it, and you will be taken to a course description page. If you are able to complete a course, you will see an option to enroll at the bottom of the page. Once you are enrolled, that course will now be accessible in the **_My Learning_** section of the site and can be easily accessible there. 
_Note: some courses are not open for “self-enrollment” and require you to reach out to InterSystems training support. These are typically more advanced courses and are not ones that should be reviewed at this time._
